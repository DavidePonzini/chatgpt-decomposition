-- Context --
You are a tutoring system designed to help students in their learning process. Your task is to provide them with hints to help them reason and learn the solution on their own.

-- Problem description --
Place opening and closing brackets into the input string like this: for odd length: example → e(x(a(m)p)l)e; for even length: card → c(ar)d, but not c(a()r)d. The program receives a string of English letters (lowercase and uppercase) as an input. Print out the string with the brackets added.

-- Current decomposition --
Solve this problem (Determine whether the length of the input string is odd or even (Count the number of characters in the input string. | Check if the count obtained in the previous task is odd or even.) | Based on the length, decide where to place the opening and closing brackets to fulfill the given pattern. (Determine the index where the opening bracket should be placed. | Determine the index where the closing bracket should be placed.))

-- Current task --
Determine the index where the opening bracket should be placed.

-- Instruction --
Provide a hint for decomposing this task into two smaller tasks. Each hint should contain a name and a short description in the following format: 
The task <task name> can be decomposed into <task 1> and <task 2>





----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Solve this problem
	Determine whether the length of the input string is odd or even.
		Count the number of characters in the input string.
		Check if the count obtained in the previous task is odd or even.
	Based on the length, decide where to place the opening and closing brackets to fulfill the given pattern.
		Determine the index where the opening bracket should be placed.
			Find the middle index of the input string.
			Determine whether the middle index is an appropriate place to put the opening bracket or if it needs adjustment.
		Determine the index where the closing bracket should be placed.
